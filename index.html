                <p><b>Global warming</b> is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system,
                    an aspect of climate change shown by temperature measurements and by multiple effects of the
                    warming. Though earlier geological periods also experienced episodes of warming, the term commonly
                    refers to the observed and continuing increase in average air and ocean temperatures since 1900
                    caused mainly by emissions of greenhouse gasses in the modern industrial economy. In the modern
                    context the terms global warming and climate change are commonly used interchangeably, but climate
                    change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes to precipitation and impacts
                    that differ by region. Many of the observed warming changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the
                    instrumental temperature record, and in historical and paleoclimate proxy records of climate change.

                <p><b>Greenhouse gases</b> trap heat radiating from Earth to space. This heat, in the form of infrared
                    radiation, gets absorbed and emitted by these gases in the planet's atmosphere warming the lower
                    atmosphere and the surface. On Earth, an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of
                    greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be warmer by about 33 °C (59 °F) than it
                    would be in their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be
                    well below the freezing temperature of water. The major greenhouse gases are water vapour, which
                    causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9–26%; methane
                    (CH4), which causes 4–9%; and ozone (O3), which causes 3–7%. Human activity since the Industrial
                    Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p><b></b>

                <p><b>Global sea level</b> has been rising since at least the start of the 20th
                    century. Between 1900 and 2016, the sea level rose by 16–21 cm (6.3–8.3 in). More precise data
                    gathered from satellite radar measurements reveal an accelerating rise of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993
                    to 2017,1554 which is a trend of roughly 30 cm (12 in) per century. This acceleration is due mostly
                    to human-caused global warming, which is driving thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of
                    land-based ice sheets and glaciers. Between 1993 and 2018, thermal expansion of the oceans
                    contributed 42% to sea level rise; the melting of temperate glaciers, 21%; Greenland, 15%; and
                    Antarctica, 8%. Climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st century.
                    The sea level will not rise uniformly everywhere on Earth, and it will even drop in some locations.

                <p><b>Plastic</b>  has been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and in 100% of sea
                    turtles species, that mistake plastic for food. And when animals ingest plastic, it can cause
                    life-threatening problems, including reduced fitness, nutrient uptake and feeding efficiency—all
                    vital for survival. Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the
                    estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments. Whether by
                    errant plastic bags or plastic straws winding their way into gutters or large amounts of mismanaged
                    plastic waste streaming from rapidly growing economies. That means that if we don’t do something
                    now, we could be facing 250 million metric tons in the ocean in less than 10 years. We can’t stand
                    by and watch the impacts of this tidal wave of plastic heading our way—neither failure nor inaction
                    is an option.
